    <h1>Battlestar Galactica - Battlestar Galactica</h1>
    <p>The Battlestar Galactica was built during the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica"> First Cylon War.</a>
       It was built to be off network so that the robotic Cylons were unable to infiltrate and cripple ships. After the Cylons
       were able to cripple the Twelve Colony fleets in the Second Cylon War, the Battlestar Galactica was one of the
       few surviving ships. It protected the remaining human fleets in its search for Earth.</p>
